# Get Started

### 1. Install Autograph

```shell
$ yarn add @armix/autograph
```

### 2. Define your Source

Any type (e.g. User) provided to `Sources` is used to provide type-safety and autocomplete when defining your Fields and custom resolvers.

The Sources you define here should match whatever data shape is returned from your database as queried by rowsâ€”not the shape of the GraphQL API schema, which is instead constructed by Autograph's Models and Fields.

```typescript
// autograph.ts

declare module "@armix/autograph/types/sources" {
  interface Sources {
    User: {
      id: number;
      name: string;
      email: string;
      password: string;
      updated_at: Date;
    };
  }
}
```

### 3. Define your Model

Models are the building blocks of your Autograph solution, where each Field manages the `get` and `set` operations that are eventually composed into Query and Mutation resolvers for Create, Read, Update, and Delete actions.

The `name` of the Model, in this case "User", will be used to lookup from the `Sources` definition to provide type-checking and autocomplete, and falls back to `any` if unable to find a mapping.

The example below just scratches the surface of all possible options that can be used to configure a Field and a Model.

Learn more with the [Model API](#coming-soon) and [Field API](#coming-soon) documentation.

```typescript
// user.ts

import { Model, Types, die } from "@armix/autograph";

const isAdminOrOwner = (currentUser, targetUser) => {
  if (!currentUser.isAdmin && targetUser.id !== currentUser.id)
    throw die("NOT_AUTHORISED");
}

export const User = new Model("User")
  .field("id", Types.ID.NonNull)

  .field("name", Types.String.NonNull)

  .field("email", Types.String.NonNull, ({ get }) => ({
    // hook into various behaviours
    onGet: (source, context) => isAdminOrOwner(context.authUser, source),
    onSet: (source, context) => isAdminOrOwner(context.authUser, source),
    // return anything (as long as it respects the field Type specified)
    get: get((source) => source.email + "anything else"),
    onUpdate: (source, context) => {
      // and optionally return data to be committed
      return {
        updated_at: new Date(),
      }
    }
  }})

  .field("password", Types.String.NonNull, ({ set }) => ({
    // disable api reading of this field
    get: null,
    // only allow admins or the owning user to change this field
    onSet: (source, context) => isAdminOrOwner(context.authUser, source),
    // and hash the password before storing it
    set: set((value) => bcrypt.hashSync(value))
  }));
```

### 4. Define your Adapter

An Adapter is a middleware between Autograph's internal Query and Mutation resolvers and an external datasource.

Prepackaged with Autograph is the `KnexAdapter` which exports its own `QueryTransport` type that can be manipulated via the `"on-query-*"` Hooks of a Model, where you can add Context aware filters (in the case of authentication) and any other behaviours you require.

If no `AdapterTransport` is mapped via the `Config` interface, then `"on-query-*"` Hooks' "transport" parameters will be `unknown`.

```shell
$ yarn add knex pg
```

```typescript
// autograph.ts

import { QueryTransport } from "@armix/autograph/adapters/knex";

declare module "@armix/autograph/types/config" {
  interface Config {
    AdapterTransport: QueryTransport;
  }
}
```

### 5. Autograph your Models

`Autograph` brings together all your Models (as well as other TypeDefs, Resolvers, wrappers, etc.) combined with your Adapter to produce a single source of `typeDefs` and `resolvers` that can be spread (`...`) directly into a GraphQL execution environment of your choice (e.g. ApolloServer). In this example, the `KnexAdapter` requires an instance of `Knex` to use for constructing and executing database queries. This particular Adapter also supports Transactions via your execution environment's request Context, given via `trx`. Read more about [Autograph Transactions](#coming-soon).

You can also write your own Adapters if the included `KnexAdapter` doesn't support the database you want to use.

```typescript
// build-autograph.ts

import Knex from "knex";
import Autograph, { KnexAdapter } from "@armix/autograph";
import { User } from "./user.ts";

function buildAutograph() {
  const knex = Knex({
    client: "pg",
    connection: "postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres",
  });
  return new Autograph({
    models: [User],
    adapter: new KnexAdapter(knex),
  });
}
```

### 6. Create your GraphQL Server

Once you have Autographed your Models, you can feed the result into a framework like ApolloServer.

```shell
$ yarn add apollo-server graphql
```

```typescript
// build-server.ts

import { ApolloServer } from "apollo-server";
import { buildAutograph } from "./build-autograph";

function buildServer() {
  const autograph = buildAutograph();

  const apollo = new ApolloServer({
    ...autograph,
  });

  return async () => {
    const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
    const { url } = await apollo.listen({ port: 5000 });
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
  };
}
```

```typescript
// index.ts

import { buildServer } from "./build-server";

const server = buildServer();
server();
```

### 7. Done!

Now that you have a working ApolloServer, using the output of your Autograph, you can inspect the generated TypeDefs schema via a GraphQL client, such as of that bundled with ApolloServer via http://localhost:5000/.

You now have a painlessly assembled set of read and write Queries and Mutations to interact with. The generated TypeDefs and Resolvers are not tied down to any particular framework per se, and are simply strings and functions that can be modified, removed, or even wrapped with granularly targeted custom logic.

```
User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  password: String!
}
Query {
  User(id: ID!) User!
  UserMany(cursor: String order: String filters: UserFilters limit: Int): UserList!
}
Mutation {
  UserCreate(data: [UserCreateInput!]!): [User!]!
  UserUpdate(data: [UserUpdateInput!]!): [User!]!
  UserDelete(ids: [ID!]!): [ID!]!
}
```
